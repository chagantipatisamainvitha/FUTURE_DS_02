Project: Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard (Tableau Public)


What I did step-by-step:
Cleaned and organized the customer dataset in Excel
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

Structured key fields like:
Tenure
Contract type
Payment method
Internet service
Churn status
Loaded the cleaned data into Tableau Public
Built an interactive dashboard with filters

Used:
KPI cards
Bar charts
Pie/Donut charts
Line trends
Segmentation visuals

Overall churn rate was clearly visible through a KPI card.

Customers on month-to-month contracts showed the highest churn.

Customers with longer tenure were more likely to stay, while new customers churned more.

Certain payment methods (like electronic check) had higher churn compared to others.

Customers using fiber internet showed higher churn than DSL users.

Retention improved significantly for customers with 1–2 year contracts.

The dashboard helped identify high-risk customer segments that need retention focus.

Filters allowed analysis by:

Contract type

Tenure group
